<pre>Conclusions:</pre>

• Schools that have a higher budget per student tend to have better math and reading scores.

• Charter schools tend to have better math and reading scores.

<pre>District Summary Objectives:</pre>

• Calculate the total number of unique schools

• Calculate the total number of students

• Calculate the total budget

• Calculate the average (mean) math score

• Calculate the average (mean) reading score

• Calculate the percentage of students who passed math

• Calculate the percentage of students who passed reading

• Calculate the percentage of students that passed both math and reading

• Create a new DataFrame for the above calculations called district_summary

<pre>School Summary Objectives:</pre>

• Select the school type

• Calculate the total student count

• Calculate the per capita spending

• Calculate the average test scores

• Calculate the number of schools with math scores of 70 or higher

<pre>Math Scores by Grade Objectives:</pre>

• Separate the data by grade

• Group by "school_name" and take the mean of each

• Select only the math_score

• Combine each of the scores above into single DataFrame called math_scores_by_grade

<pre>Reading Scores by Grade Objectives:</pre>

• Separate the data by grade

• Group by "school_name" and take the mean of each

• Select only the reading_score

• Combine each of the scores above into single DataFrame called reading_scores_by_grade

<pre>Scores by School Spending Objectives:</pre>

• Use pd.cut with the provided code to bin the data by the spending ranges

• Calculate the averages

• Create the spending_summary DataFrame using the binned and averaged spending data

<pre>Scores by School Size Objectives:</pre> 

• Use pd.cut with the provided code to bin the data by the school sizes

• Calculate the averages

• Create the size_summary DataFrame using the binned and averaged size data

<pre>Scores by School Type Objectives:</pre>

• Group the per_school_summary DataFrame by "School Type" and average the results

• Select the new column data

•Create a new DataFrame called type_summary that uses the new column data
